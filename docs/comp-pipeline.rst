          If you can't find it, please contact your TD.
          You know ftrack_connect is already running on your machine, if you see the tiny green box
          in the application tray on the top right of your desktop.

Artist Workflow
---------------

Once an artist is assigned a compositing task in Ftrack, the artist must navigate to the Ftrack task
and open Nuke from the actions menu.
