Artist Workflow
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Submitting to Dailies
---------------------

If for any reason, the post render script cannot upload the media to Ftrack, the artist can do so through
the Ftrack web browser. Click on the task, then click on the actions menu and select the "Upload Media"
action.

Once the action UI opens, copy paste your file into the text box and hit submit.

The jobs icon in the top right corner of your browser will give you an update on your job.
